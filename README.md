Project Explanation for Django CSV Analysis Project:

This project is a Django-based web application that allows users to upload CSV files, perform data analysis using pandas and numpy, and display the results and visualizations on a web interface. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. Django Setup
The project starts with setting up a Django project and creating a Django app within it. The app is configured in the project's settings to be recognized by Django.

2. File Upload Feature
Model and Form: A Django model is created to handle the uploaded CSV files, and a form is provided to upload these files through the web interface.
View: A view is set up to manage the file upload process. When a file is uploaded, it is temporarily stored for processing.

3. Data Processing
Reading CSV Files: The uploaded CSV file is read using pandas.
Displaying Data: The first few rows of the CSV file are displayed to give an overview of the data.
Summary Statistics: The application calculates summary statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation for numerical columns.
Handling Missing Values: The application identifies and handles any missing values in the data.

4. Data Visualization
Generating Plots: Basic plots such as histograms are generated using matplotlib or seaborn. These plots help in visualizing the distribution of numerical data.
Displaying Plots: The generated plots are displayed on the web page, allowing users to visually interpret the data.

5. User Interface
Django Templates: The user interface is built using Django templates. It is designed to be simple and user-friendly, displaying the data analysis results and visualizations in a clear and organized manner.

Summary of Steps to Set Up the Project
Clone the Repository: Clone the project repository from GitHub.
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment: Set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
Install Required Packages: Install the necessary packages listed in the requirements.txt file.
Apply Migrations: Apply database migrations to set up the database schema.
